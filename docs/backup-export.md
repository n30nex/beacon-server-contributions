# Database and saved-config export

`beacon-backup` is the export foundation for issue #72. It produces a private,
versioned `.tar.gz` using PostgreSQL's `pg_dump`. It does not yet provide a web
interface, account login, scheduled/remote storage or automatic import.

Build it with `go build ./cmd/beacon-backup`. Install `pg_dump` in the same runtime
as this command; an installation on the Docker host does not install it inside an
app container. Use a client of the same major version as the source PostgreSQL
server; an older client cannot dump a newer server.

Set libpq's standard `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER` and TLS settings.
`PGDATABASE` is required and must be a plain database name. Prefer a private
`PGPASSFILE` (0600 on Unix) or an existing libpq service configuration for secrets.
The command does not load `.env`, read `POSTGRES_DSN`, start Beacon, run migrations,
subscribe to MQTT or connect to Redis. Connection settings are not command-line
arguments and client stderr is not printed because it can contain private data.

For example, after configuring those connection settings:

```sh
beacon-backup -config /private/config.yaml -output /private/beacon-20260913.tar.gz
```

Use an output directory controlled by the operator. Staging directories are
0700 and files are 0600 on Unix; Windows operators must use a directory with
appropriately restricted ACLs. Existing destinations, including symlinks, are
never replaced. A hard link publishes the finished archive atomically, so the
destination filesystem must support hard links. Unsupported filesystems fail
without publishing an output. Normal failure, timeout and handled interruption
remove temporary files; a power loss or SIGKILL can leave a private
`.beacon-backup-*` staging directory for the operator to inspect.

## Protected download API

Set `backup.enabled: true` in saved YAML and configure the existing admin bearer
key to enable `GET /api/v1/admin/backup`. Supply the key only in the `Authorization:
Bearer ...` header over HTTPS. No query parameters or request body are accepted.
This is an operator API, not account login or a browser admin panel. Keep it off
on public previews that do not need private exports.

The server requires `pg_dump` on its own PATH when this option is enabled. The
Docker image includes PostgreSQL 16's client by default; build argument
`POSTGRES_CLIENT_MAJOR` selects another available Alpine package. Match the source
database major version. A client on the host or in a different container is not
sufficient. No Docker socket or host-command bridge is used.

The download uses the startup `POSTGRES_DSN`, not the standalone export's ambient
`PGDATABASE`. This first adapter supports a single-host `postgres://` or
`postgresql://` URL with an explicit user and database. Passwords, IPv6 and URL
escaping are supported. It copies TLS settings, `passfile`, `connect_timeout`,
`application_name`, `target_session_attrs` and `options`; known `pool_*` controls
are omitted from libpq. Supported PG environment defaults are captured at startup
and URL values override them. Prefer explicit `sslmode=verify-full` and a trusted
`sslrootcert` for remote databases; password-file/TLS paths must be readable in
the same runtime. Their contents are not included in the archive.

Keyword DSNs, service indirection, multiple hosts, duplicate/unknown query options,
newer protocol negotiation settings and service-file values with line breaks or
edge whitespace are rejected rather than silently changing targets or TLS policy.
Ambient `PGSERVICE`, `PGSERVICEFILE`, `PGSSLNEGOTIATION`, `PGMINPROTOCOLVERSION`,
`PGMAXPROTOCOLVERSION` and `PGTZ` are also unsupported for this adapter. The
standalone command retains native PG* support for those deployments. Errors do
not echo the DSN. Native connection settings live only in a 0600 service file in
private staging; process arguments contain no connection string or credential,
and no request changes Beacon's environment.

Only one export or transfer is allowed at a time; another request receives 409.
The existing ten-minute/1 GiB SQL/1 MiB YAML limits apply, and disconnecting
cancels an in-progress export. The completed transfer has a ten-minute write
deadline. Temporary files are removed after completion/failure/cancellation;
abrupt process termination can leave private staging. Responses use `no-store`
and a fixed attachment filename. A failed export returns an error without any
partial archive. Authentication missing/invalid is 401, unconfigured access is
503, invalid input is 400, export failure is 500 and timeout is 504.

Provision a private writable temporary directory (`TMPDIR` on Unix) with space
for roughly twice the SQL limit plus overhead. A small read-only-container tmpfs
is insufficient for a large backup. Exports include saved YAML verbatim and may
include keys/message data; the exclusions below still apply. This API does not
implement archive upload, import/overwrite, schedules or remote storage.

## Format 1

The tar contains exactly three regular files with fixed names:

- `manifest.json`: format version, creation time, exporter version, dump format,
  uncompressed payload sizes/SHA-256 hashes and explicit exclusions.
- `database.sql`: one consistent `pg_dump` snapshot of schema and data, including
  Beacon's migration journal. Ownership, ACLs and tablespace placement are omitted
  so objects can be restored under the destination operator.
- `config.yaml`: the supplied saved file, byte-for-byte, including comments and
  any keys. It is captured before the database snapshot; avoid configuration edits
  during export if the files must describe the same deployment state.

This is sensitive, unencrypted data. Store and transfer it privately. The bundle
does not include deployment environment variables, `.env`, external files such as
`borderFile` inputs or TLS keys, runtime-only changes, PostgreSQL roles/cluster
settings, Redis or service/deployment files. Retain those separately. A config
export is not the sanitized admin-config response and is not a complete server
recovery package by itself.

Defaults are ten minutes and a 1 GiB uncompressed SQL limit. Saved YAML is capped
at 1 MiB. `-timeout` and `-max-bytes` set finite positive limits (SQL maximum 1 TiB).
Allow disk space for both the uncompressed SQL and compressed bundle, roughly
twice the chosen SQL limit plus overhead. A five-second lock-wait limit prevents
waiting indefinitely behind schema changes. Export failure publishes no backup;
check the client version, privileges, connection settings and available capacity
privately. The command deliberately does not expose raw client diagnostics.

## Restore verification

Use trusted bundles only: PostgreSQL dumps can contain executable SQL. Inspect
the fixed members, verify the gzip stream and the manifest's payload sizes and
hashes, and extract into private staging. For a **new, empty disposable database**,
with its own explicit `PGDATABASE` and target-role connection settings:

```sh
psql -X --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on --single-transaction --file database.sql
```

Restore with a compatible PostgreSQL version and the required extensions already
available. Reconcile the migration journal and representative records/relationships
before relying on the bundle. Review saved configuration and restore external
secrets/files separately before starting a new Beacon server. Never restore over
live data simply to test an export; overwrite/import requires a separate workflow.

[password files](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-pgpass.html).

CI runs the compiled command and its PostgreSQL round-trip test with a dedicated
PostgreSQL 16 service. To repeat it privately, build the command, set the `PG*`
connection variables for an isolated test server and set
`BEACON_BACKUP_TEST_POSTGRES=1` plus `BEACON_BACKUP_TEST_BINARY` to the command's
absolute path. Run `go test ./internal/backup -run '^TestExportPostgres$' -v`.
The test role needs permission to create/drop its two randomly named databases;
the test migrates and restores only those databases and removes them afterward.
